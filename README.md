# Welcome to the Smoke Extractor Repository!

Are you tired of inhaling smoke and fumes while soldering? Look no further! This portable smoke extractor is here to evolve your soldering experience.

This repository contains all the information you need to build your own smoke extractor using readily available components.

| [PCB](https://github.com/nguterresn/smoke-extractor/tree/master/pcb/1v1) | [STL](https://github.com/nguterresn/smoke-extractor/tree/master/stl) | [GERBER](https://github.com/nguterresn/smoke-extractor/blob/master/pcb/1v1/jlcpcb/production_files/GERBER-smoke_extractorV1_1.zip) | [BOM](https://github.com/nguterresn/smoke-extractor/blob/master/pcb/1v1/jlcpcb/production_files/BOM-smoke_extractorV1_1.csv) |
|-----|-----|--------|-----|

Below is a list of what you need. Let's start with the PCB:

* Take the [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/nguterresn/smoke-extractor/blob/master/pcb/1v1/jlcpcb/production_files/BOM-smoke_extractorV1_1.csv) and order from [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com).
* Take the [compressed gerber files](https://github.com/nguterresn/smoke-extractor/blob/master/pcb/1v1/jlcpcb/production_files/GERBER-smoke_extractorV1_1.zip) and order the PCB from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com)

To 3D print the [enclosure](https://github.com/nguterresn/smoke-extractor/tree/master/stl/1v1), I would recommend to print it vertically with supports only where the PCB fits and at the top.

* You can find the files for the enclosure at [Thinginverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6496883) or on the [repository](https://github.com/nguterresn/smoke-extractor/tree/master/stl/1v1).
* You can find the sliced model and ready to print file for BambuLab printers here.

And finally, necessary items you can find in Amazon:

* Buy the Fume's filter. I took a [filter used on cat litter boxes](https://www.amazon.se/gp/product/B07WJ1Y1CH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and trimmed it to 80x80mm.
* Buy a [80x80x25mm 12V fan](https://www.amazon.se/-/en/1-06W-80x80x25mm-56-1mÂ³-2600U-EE80251S31000U999/dp/B07ZBNZQ2S/ref=sr_1_3?crid=MVLR8KCZBU2A&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yyIoiUBXEqPdx7PXhLvxQ6DgrM7XN99XWWnRf-wjLIC2jV-B3UQ4XywT_NGIYMAKHvOpfRhJtW1-Edui-ORV4xDNA9OV7_BThwgb9X33OIwgTvXAGk9CamoQANMFjjYQfQlXwd1fQ9uBfTSz37shrT1HXBxxIDawscOyjEqbqhflptzGCS32OoU-07Krv_tXsq_2aFJ8kRP7iFG2Fm3--l_kvcWPGcEGKE2OmgzGbOBmr5wPGlOs1hTMt8ZC6lYbEhc1kAilJPhcBsXh4ESUahyO5wKTHMeF1VTbrVZGBB4.kkiZ6oj-aX831UgWn2JdLQOQZ6zxw4aFCHIgBYpVpvM&dib_tag=se&keywords=fan+80x80+12v&qid=1708787756&sprefix=fan+80x80+12v%2Caps%2C92&sr=8-3). Any fan should suffice (as long as is within 80x80x25mm), however some fans are specially built for increased air flow and low noise, such as [Noctua ones](https://www.amazon.se/-/en/Noctua-NF-R8-Redux-1800-PWM-performance/dp/B00KF7MVI2/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1FC5ZC8PZ4Y1V&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nR2-oZtf9V-GN4B_sLLcsZsVkm8SOGSnasAzNeWOD6hcB3mSpQLWiwCVTJMJFPlbKCy_ke6oPzXiC_dCjItMRWk4W2Ovn52BVgXElBXkFmTP6l7XVI3kmm0ca1A7RbpRjykKHF7tixTPcCfjPfQAZWGbW_Z9oki_9TZgYak1CsVwYHUm23W-Hg3x731fiD-MuwIXEwUoA63P653yK8mSEY_l5Cigo0ODth0iAE_t3bkkZqnOJmHH7ZiWD8j_RxoCN1rxiMu7Us7g22hvU4B-fkI_2iGjdmFk5K9EcHZOC7k.gXca1K5ZeESalsrob-K74d8LU7yIyzcaKxv8FWTVuFg&dib_tag=se&keywords=noctua+80mm&qid=1708787907&sprefix=noctua+80m%2Caps%2C99&sr=8-3).
* Buy a [18350 battery holder from Amazon](https://www.amazon.se/-/en/3-7V-18650-Battery-Plastic-Storage/dp/B07MM1NHHL/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2S11BRPI1SFDN&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._ZvHPBCAkFADy9zm7AwcSj7BRWLtre4sQFriTdwADeFz38LD4PHVUqlo92Mr_qlHYvC9n_Wa976J5boEqPog5omuMcZvPQ4p1LHz4h0jg6txf33FL-gPQxLrHZZhL4yq8NlFmkt63MQLfnwRS_1h4xymLn59qeygErN50ODLHJ0hU8t5k7_wpVhyZUxli8YBID3BzOhYgPiTP1B--dGFmmnfPB8NTCn6rncl5h0IL3-LFAp2EmgDpC0F7w4vtddbEfQfdrLjZNarntx32AIs1I1Aa09CHDQLrP6kLzb9kvw.BXkkd7rySFMaa2OdXrMOJ7WG7TBaLJAFz9LXq7sVjNo&dib_tag=se&keywords=18350+battery+holder&qid=1708787362&sprefix=18350+battery+holder%2Caps%2C109&sr=8-3).

Once you have received everything you ordered, I recommend to use an hot air gun or a soldering plate to solder the PCB.

After the soldering process, I recommended soldering the fan power cables into the 12V and GND pads on the PCB, such that the fan is left connected to the PCB.

Start by adding the fan into the top part and match with the bottom pins.
Place the PCB; use two M3-5mm screws to fix it if the PCB is loose.

The cables are hidden below the fan and behind the PCB.

To assemble the back lid you will also need 2x M3-5mm screws and 2x M3-10mm screws.

Happy soldering!
